# Student-grade-prediction

The purpose of this project is to build a hybrid model based on a stacking approach and compare its accuracy with those of the individual base models. The model hybridizes K-nearest neighbours, Random forests, XGBoost and Multi-layer perceptron networks to improve the accuracy of grade prediction by enabling a combination of strengths of different algorithms for the creation of a more robust and accurate model. The proposed model achieved an average overall accuracy of around 90.9% for 10 epochs, which is significantly higher than that achieved by any of the individual algorithms of the stack. The results demonstrate the improvement of prediction results but using a stacking approach. This study has significant implications for academic institutions which can help them make informed grade predictions for the improvement of student outcomes.
